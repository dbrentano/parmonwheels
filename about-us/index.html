            <p class="about-text">
                Chris's journey into the culinary world began in his mother's kitchen, where he first learned the art of
                cooking.
                These early experiences sparked a lifelong passion that eventually led him to Italy for formal training
                in traditional techniques.
                Today, Chris combines his deep-rooted love for cooking with the skills he acquired abroad, ensuring that
                each private dinner is not just a meal,
                but a memorable and personal culinary experience. His dishes are a celebration of his journey, blending
                the warmth of his earliest lessons
                with the sophistication of Italian cuisine.
