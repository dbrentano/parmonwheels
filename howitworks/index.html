        <h1>How It Works</h1>

        <div class="how-step">
            <h2>Step 1: Arrival and Setup</h2>
            <p><strong>Time:</strong> We arrive two hours before the meal begins to set up and prepare for an
                unforgettable
                evening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-step">
            <h2>Step 2: Let the Fun Begin!</h2>
            <p><strong>Fresh Mozzarella Ball Toss:</strong> Guests are invited to participate in a fresh mozzarella ball
                toss to get everyone in the festive spirit. Engage in this playful activity that promises fun and
                laughter,
                setting the tone for a delightful evening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-step">
            <h2>Step 3: Starters and Appetizers</h2>
            <p><strong>Appetizers:</strong> Enjoy a selection of Brooklyn/Queens Italian style appetizers that set the
                stage
                for a night of indulgent dining.</p>
            <p><strong>Salad:</strong> A fresh and vibrant salad served with a dressing of your choice to cleanse the
                palate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-step">
            <h2>Step 4: The Main Attraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Main Course:</strong> A carefully selected main course that complements the pasta, crafted from
                the
                finest ingredients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="how-step">
            <h2>Step 5: Sweet Ending</h2>
            <p><strong>Dessert:</strong> Conclude your meal with a delightful dessert, the perfect ending to your
                Italian
                feast.</p>

                your
                space is left spotless, so you can continue to relax and enjoy the evening without any worries.</p>
